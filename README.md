### What is this?

An Android application which provides a server in local network and other clients can connect 
through their browsers and donwload files and APKs.
This is a practice to learn how Http works.
It's based on pure sockets and has no library nor any dependency.

### Roadmap

- [x] Add a loading page while server is being built.
- [x] Add async responsing feature.
- [x] Add support for Partial Content Responsing. (An important feature that is required in many browser interactions)

## Notes 

- You may not Download anything in tge app itself. Try in a browser instead.
