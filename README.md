An Android application which provides a server in local network and other clients can connect 
through their browsers and donwload files and APKs.
This is a practice to learn how Http works.
It's based on pure sockets and has no library nor any dependency.

- [x] Add a loading page while server is being built.

- [ ] Add support of "range" Http header. 
- [ ] Add support for partial content responsing.
- [ ] Query to how continue downloading a stopped file.
